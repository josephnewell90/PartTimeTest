##Super Fun Store!

Here you'll find a sample design and you need to recreate it as close as you can!

This is a coding exercise I use when I interview candidates for potential frontend development roles at Wallaroo Media. It you were smart enough to look up my GitHub profile before your interview and found this repo, I like you already.

###Requirements

Try to make index.html look like the picture below in a browser:

![alt text](https://github.com/josephnewell/PartTimeTest/mockups/mobileVersion.png "Mobile Version")
![alt text](https://github.com/josephnewell/PartTimeTest/mockups/desktopVersion.png "Desktop Version")

* Use the images in the assets folder to create the design (NOTE: The images in the assets folder are FINAL images, the images in the mockups are simply placeholders. Use the images in the assets folder.)
* Use the "Montserrat" Google Font
* On Desktop, when you mouse over one of the product images, the black should go away as well as the words
* Feel free to use Google or any resource you need to get it done. Remember to properly accredit any code you take from other sources

There is some starter HTML and CSS code written out for you to give you a head start. Be warned: The code done broke! You can use all, some or none of the starter code. Feel free it completely rewrite it. The only criteria is that the page looks and functions as described.


###Tips

* Feel free to Google around during this exercise
* You can also ask me questions, just not directly if something is the right answer
* Keep your inspector open. It's hard to debug code in a text editor
